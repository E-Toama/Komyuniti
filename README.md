## Frontend Setup

Fill the following values in the `local.properties` file at the top level of the `Komyuniti` folder.

```
# URl for backend
SERVER_URL="http://10.0.2.2:3000/"
```

`http://10.0.2.2` refers to your own local machine relative to the android virtual device. Therefore keep that IP address when testing locally. Finally adjust to the port on which your backend is running on.
